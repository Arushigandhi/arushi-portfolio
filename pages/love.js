          <h1>Hello meri jaan,</h1>
          <h2>
            There's not much that I haven't told you about. When it comes to
            expressing all my love to Aryamann Ningombam, I'd like to believe I
            have a PhD. in that. I love you. Sooo much. And, I miss you even
            more. I miss our days together, horsing around campus, sitting in
            secluded spots and chatting. Me coming to you every hour in IC just
            to see you, give you a hug, give you a kiss, make obscene jokes,
            annoy you, flirt with you, sleep on your godi (the fact that i
            literally slept in your lap while you coded is sooo funny now that I
            think about it. Peak moments man I miss that) How is it that I could
            spend the entire day with you and still have gazillion things to say
            and never get enough of you. I miss us eating food together and
            planning dates and booking hotels. I sooo miss holding your arm
            while we just walked to class or some shit, or how I waited for
            breaks between classes to see you for 15 mins. I was thinking about
            how you used to ekdam se kiss me outside coworking door in the dark
            and pick me up and shit. So hot. Goals bro we are. I miss you
            scolding me for not fixing Spotify and making me fix it in the
            middle of Apoorva. You probably don't even know why I was so mad at
            you for doing that. It's because I wanted to sit with you in some
            shed and make out and cuddle but noooo you want to fix my Spotify
            instead of fix each other's orgasms. I miss me bringing my entire
            laptop and mouse and shit to you everytime there was a tech error
            outside my brain's bandwidth and I love how patiently you helped me.
            <br /> <br />I think the thing I probably find the funniest is that
            I ever though we'd get bored of each other. I can't get enough of
            spending time with you and discusing and planning our future
            together. The fact that I have to wait sooo long to finally see you
            is tooooooo fucking annoying to deal with. Honestly dekha jaye toh
            teri hi galti hai ki bola expectations mat rakh, bitch don't you
            know meee cause no matter how much I try, I'll always want to see
            you and see your dick, more importantly. Honestly, you know what you
            need to stop going to the gym and getting so hot. My answer is two
            fold: 1) Other bitches get to see you and I don't and that is a
            crime. 2) It makes me horny, esp in the gym thinking about gymming
            with you in that white tank top and grey shorts and damn.... why
            can't you make that happen huh itna bolta hai im aryamann im
            aryamann, yeh karke dikha fir karna
            <br /> <br />
            You're my greatest inspiration Aryamann. Everything you do, say,
            feel, buy, sell, have an opinion on, matters to me. It matters too
            much. And I take it personally bro ahahahah. Today, you were like
            I'm going to buy a watch and I took that personally lmao. I was like
            kyun yeh humara paise kharch raha hai bc. Everything you do matters
            to me my love. I love how we are right now and I can't wait for our
            life together to get started someday. If you think about it, it's
            good only we have to do LDR, karma will make it such that because we
            had to spend time apart rn so we'll be together for the rest of our
            7 janam hihihahah. I'm going to 10-12 hours in a day all up in your
            face in one tiny 1-bhk for several years, I'm going to be there when
            you poop, when you brush, when you make eggs, when you pack your
            bag, when we have sex, when we cuddle, when we watch a movie in bed,
            when we order takeout, when we plan our Maldives trip, when we plan
            our financials, when we get hottest entrepreneur jodi of the year
            award, everything basically whore. You should be very scared, I'm
            not going to give you any personal space, lauda mera "me time", only
            arushi time, I'll buy a 2xl tshirt and sleep in it with you bro
            watch, full invasion of you and your dick.
            <br /> <br />I think that is enough love for now. Otherwise, I'll
            start crying again. Just know my love for you is more than
            Kilimanjaro.
            <br /> <br />
            Missing you always, The hottest bitch you'll ever fuck ðŸ˜˜
